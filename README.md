# Creative-and-Innovative-Project
Layman Laziness with Tuned architecture of MobileNet
It is a web-based interface which
mainly focuses on laymen who have zero level ( but not necessarily )
knowledge in programming but a little in Machine learning and Deep learning
who wishes to train their own model to solve some issues they face in their
life. For that, we have provided this simple interface where they shall simply
upload the data and train the model in clicks. An interface to test the trained
model is also provided. This supports three forms of data such as Image,
Audio and a simple 2D data in JSON format. This project mainly focuses on
making a problem solver less dependant on programming as it takes a lots of
time to learn and understand Deep learning and Machine learning algorithms
and its implementations.
